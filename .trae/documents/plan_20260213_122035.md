I will enhance the leaderboard functionality to ensure every game is visible and verifiable.

**1. Enhance Leaderboard UI with "Recent Records" Tab**
   - **Why**: Standard leaderboards only show the top 10 scores. If you play a game with a lower score, it won't appear, causing confusion ("Why isn't my game recorded?").
   - **Change**: Add a **"Recent Records" (最近记录)** tab to the Leaderboard modal.
   - **Details**: 
     - "High Scores" (Top 10) - Existing functionality.
     - "Recent" (Last 50) - Shows the latest games played by anyone, ordered by time. This guarantees your latest game appears immediately at the top.

**2. Add Immediate Game-Over Feedback**
   - **Why**: Users need confirmation that their score was actually saved to the database.
   - **Change**: Update `snake.vue` to explicitly display **"成绩已保存 (Score Saved)"** in the Game Over overlay when logged in.

**3. Implementation Steps**
   - **Backend (`src/utils/db.js`)**: Add `getRecentScores(game)` function to fetch data ordered by `date DESC`.
   - **Frontend (`src/views/home/home.vue`)**: 
     - Add tab switching (🏆 高分榜 / ⏱️ 最新记录) in the Leaderboard modal.
     - Connect tabs to the respective data fetching functions.
   - **Game (`src/views/snake/snake.vue`)**: Update `gameOver` logic to append success message.

This ensures that "Every game played" is both recorded (backend) and explicitly displayed (frontend "Recent" tab).
